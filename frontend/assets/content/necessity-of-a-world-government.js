        `Climate Change and associated problems like the sixth mass extinction and the exploitation of natural resources threaten the natural livelihood of all human beings. Fighting climate change will only be effective for the next 10 years, according to the IPCC. From there on critical tipping points will be reached, triggering a cascade of self reinforcing events that will result in a climate collapse. Within the next 5 decades, a drastic shortage of water and nutrition, the resulting wars for these resources and the devastating effects of natural disasters, like wildfires and floods, will decimate the world population and cause unimaginable suffering for all humans on earth.`,
        `To prevent this catastrophe, every nation on earth has to
            contribute with all their power. But since spending the
            money and effort needed to decarbonize a country is a short
            term disadvantage in the global economic competition, no
            nation is willing to act sufficiently. This social
            phenomenon is known as “tragedy of the commons”. It states
            that every country will blame others for not acting, rather
            than taking measures itself. This egoistic approach of
            maximizing short term benefits is causing global inaction
            that will inevitably lead to the climate collapse in the
            long term.`,
        `This problem can only be solved if the common good is valued
            higher than national interests. Since nations will close
            their eyes to international problems, a united global
            government is needed to fight this global crisis. It will
            forge a global plan to combat the climate crisis and make
            sure that every country plays its role. The whole world
            contributed to this problem, now the whole world needs to
            contribute to the solution.`,
        `In the future, the use of global resources has to be
            coordinated globally. This will prevent a handful of people
            from making a profit in the short term by causing suffering
            for many in the long term. In addition, unprecedented levels
            of international cooperation will finally enable smart
            global energy and resource utilisation.`,
